## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Fraud Detection

```python
from fraud_detection.core.fraud_detection_agent import FraudDetectionAgent
from fraud_detection.memory.models import Transaction, Location, DeviceInfo
from decimal import Decimal

# Initialize the fraud detection agent
agent = FraudDetectionAgent()

# Create a transaction
transaction = Transaction(
    id="tx_12345",
    user_id="user_789",
    amount=Decimal("1500.00"),
    currency="USD",
    merchant_id="merchant_456",
    location=Location(country="US", city="New York"),
    device_info=DeviceInfo(device_id="device_123", ip_address="192.168.1.1"),
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)

# Analyze the transaction
result = agent.analyze_transaction(transaction)

print(f"Fraud Score: {result.fraud_score}")
print(f"Decision: {result.decision}")
print(f"Reasons: {result.reasons}")
```

### Using Specialized Agents

```python
from fraud_detection.agents.specialized.specialized_agents.transaction_analyzer import TransactionAnalyzer
from fraud_detection.agents.specialized.specialized_agents.base_agent import AgentConfiguration

# Configure the agent
config = AgentConfiguration(
    agent_id="transaction_analyzer_001",
    capabilities=["transaction_validation", "anomaly_detection"]
)

# Initialize the agent
analyzer = TransactionAnalyzer(config)

# Process a transaction
result = analyzer.process(transaction)
```

### Memory-Aware Decisions

```python
from fraud_detection.memory.memory_manager import MemoryManager
from fraud_detection.memory.context_manager import ContextManager

# Initialize memory systems
memory_manager = MemoryManager()
context_manager = ContextManager()

# Store transaction history
memory_manager.store_transaction(transaction)

# Get user context for decision making
user_context = context_manager.get_user_context(user_id="user_789")

# Make context-aware decision
decision = agent.analyze_with_context(transaction, user_context)
```

### Real-time Stream Processing

```python
from fraud_detection.streaming.transaction_stream_processor import TransactionStreamProcessor

# Initialize stream processor
processor = TransactionStreamProcessor()

# Process transaction stream
async def process_stream():
    async for transaction in transaction_stream:
        result = await processor.process_transaction(transaction)
        if result.is_fraud:
            await handle_fraud_alert(result)

# Run the processor
await process_stream()
```
