# Task 5.2 Completion Summary: Organize Deployment Scripts

## Overview
Successfully organized deployment scripts by moving them from the `scripts/` directory to `infrastructure/aws/deployment/` and updating all references throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Movements (using git mv to preserve history)
- ✅ `scripts/deploy_blue_green.sh` → `infrastructure/aws/deployment/deploy_blue_green.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/rollback_deployment.sh` → `infrastructure/aws/deployment/rollback_deployment.sh`

### 2. CI/CD Workflow Updates
Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
- ✅ Updated blue-green deployment command path (line ~311)
- ✅ Updated rollback command path (line ~324)

**Before:**
```yaml
./scripts/deploy_blue_green.sh production
./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh production
```

**After:**
```yaml
./infrastructure/aws/deployment/deploy_blue_green.sh production
./infrastructure/aws/deployment/rollback_deployment.sh production
```

### 3. Documentation Updates
Updated `docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`:
- ✅ Updated rollback command in "Deploying New Version" section
- ✅ Updated rollback command in "High Error Rate Alert" incident response section

### 4. Internal Script Path Updates

#### deploy_blue_green.sh
- ✅ Updated infrastructure deployment path to use relative path from new location
- ✅ Updated health check script paths (3 occurrences)
- ✅ Updated test script path
- ✅ Updated decommission stack script reference in output message

#### rollback_deployment.sh
- ✅ Updated health check script paths (2 occurrences)
- ✅ Updated test script path
- ✅ Updated notification script path
- ✅ Updated decommission stack script reference in output message

## Verification

### Files Moved Successfully
```bash
$ git status
renamed:    scripts/deploy_blue_green.sh -> infrastructure/aws/deployment/deploy_blue_green.sh
renamed:    scripts/rollback_deployment.sh -> infrastructure/aws/deployment/rollback_deployment.sh
```

### All References Updated
- ✅ CI/CD workflow references updated
- ✅ Documentation references updated
- ✅ Internal script paths corrected for new location
- ✅ No broken references found in codebase

## Impact Assessment

### Zero Breaking Changes
- All script functionality preserved
- Git history maintained through `git mv`
- All references updated to new paths
- Scripts will work from new location

### Improved Organization
- Deployment scripts now co-located with infrastructure code
- Clear separation between deployment and utility scripts
- Follows the design document structure
- Easier for DevOps engineers to find deployment tools

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 6.3**: Deployment scripts organized by deployment type
- Blue-green deployment script moved to infrastructure/aws/deployment/
- Rollback deployment script moved to infrastructure/aws/deployment/

✅ **Requirement 9.3**: Script paths updated in CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow updated with new paths
- All deployment and rollback commands reference new locations

## Next Steps

Task 5.2 is complete. The next task in the sequence is:
- **Task 5.3**: Update infrastructure configuration
  - Move config files to infrastructure/aws/config/
  - Update import paths in infrastructure code
  - Create infrastructure/README.md with usage guide

## Notes

- The scripts reference other scripts (health_check.py, send_notification.py, etc.) that are still in the `scripts/` directory
- These will be organized in later tasks (Task 8: Organize scripts and utilities)
- The relative paths have been updated to work from the new location (../../../scripts/)
- When those scripts are moved, we'll need to update these paths again
