# Full Test Suite Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Task:** 11.2 Run full test suite  
**Status:** Completed with findings

## Executive Summary

The full test suite was executed against the reorganized codebase. The test discovery phase successfully collected **602 test items**, but encountered **10 import errors** preventing some tests from running. These errors fall into three categories:

1. **Missing dependencies** (faker, moto)
2. **Import path issues** from reorganization
3. **Test file issues** (syntax errors, module-level server startup)

## Test Discovery Results

- **Total Tests Collected:** 602 items
- **Import Errors:** 10 files
- **Test Discovery:** ✓ Successful (pytest found and collected tests)
- **Test Execution:** ✗ Blocked by import errors

## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: Missing Dependencies

Several test files require optional dependencies that are not installed:

1. **faker module** (3 files affected):
   - `tests/integration/test_fraud_detection.py`
   - `tests/integration/test_multicurrency.py`
   - `tests/integration/test_with_files.py`
   - **Cause:** `scripts/utilities/transaction_generator.py` imports `faker`
   - **Impact:** Integration tests that use transaction generation cannot run

2. **moto module** (1 file affected):
   - `tests/unit/memory/test_memory_manager.py`
   - **Cause:** Test uses moto for mocking AWS DynamoDB
   - **Impact:** Unit tests for memory manager cannot run

### Category 2: Import Path Issues from Reorganization

Several files have import statements that need updating after reorganization:

1. **infrastructure.agent_orchestrator** (3 files affected):
   - `tests/test_ai_agent_validation.py`
   - `tests/test_integration.py`
   - `tests/test_load_performance.py`
   - **Cause:** `src/fraud_detection/core/unified_fraud_detection_system.py` imports from `infrastructure.agent_orchestrator`
   - **Root Issue:** The import path needs to be updated to match new structure
   - **Impact:** Core system tests cannot run

2. **agent_example module** (1 file affected):
   - `tests/integration/test_agent.py`
   - **Cause:** Imports `from agent_example import agent_invocation`
   - **Root Issue:** `agent_example.py` was moved to `examples/basic/` but import not updated
   - **Impact:** Agent integration test cannot run

3. **tests.unit.memory.context_manager** (1 file affected):
   - `tests/unit/memory/test_context_manager.py`
   - **Cause:** Uses relative import `from .context_manager import ContextManager`
   - **Root Issue:** The actual module is in `src/fraud_detection/memory/`, not in tests
   - **Impact:** Context manager unit test cannot run

### Category 3: Test File Issues

1. **Syntax Error** (1 file affected):
   - `tests/integration/test_memory_integration.py`
   - **Error:** `IndentationError: unexpected indent` at line 292
   - **Impact:** Memory integration tests cannot run

2. **Module-Level Server Startup** (1 file affected):
   - `tests/integration/memory/test_create_memory.py`
   - **Issue:** Contains `app.run()` at module level, starts server during import
   - **Impact:** Causes port binding errors, blocks test discovery
   - **Note:** This file was excluded from test run to allow other tests to proceed

## Comparison with Baseline

**Baseline Status:** No baseline test results file found (`baseline_test_discovery.json`)

**Current Status:**
- Test discovery: ✓ Successful (602 tests found)
- Test structure: ✓ Properly organized in `tests/` directory
- Import resolution: ✗ 10 files have import errors

## Coverage Analysis

Coverage analysis was not completed due to import errors preventing test execution. Once import issues are resolved, coverage should be measured against:
- `src/fraud_detection/` (primary coverage target)
- `src/bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit/` (secondary coverage target)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Import Paths in Core System**
   - Update `src/fraud_detection/core/unified_fraud_detection_system.py`
   - Change `from infrastructure.agent_orchestrator import ...` to correct path
   - This will unblock 3 test files

2. **Fix Test Import Issues**
   - Update `tests/integration/test_agent.py` to import from `examples.basic.agent_example`
   - Fix `tests/unit/memory/test_context_manager.py` to import from `src.fraud_detection.memory`
   - Fix indentation error in `tests/integration/test_memory_integration.py` line 292

3. **Fix Test File with Server Startup**
   - Remove `app.run()` from `tests/integration/memory/test_create_memory.py`
   - Convert to proper test function that doesn't start server at module level

### Optional Actions (Dependencies)

4. **Install Optional Test Dependencies** (if tests should run):
   ```bash
   pip install faker moto
   ```
   - Or mark these tests as requiring optional dependencies
   - Or skip these tests in CI if dependencies not available

### Verification Steps

After fixes are applied:
1. Run `python -m pytest tests/ --co -q` to verify test discovery
2. Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to execute all tests
3. Run `python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/fraud_detection` for coverage
4. Compare results against this baseline

## Test Organization Validation

✓ **Directory Structure:** Tests properly organized in `tests/` directory  
✓ **Test Discovery:** Pytest successfully discovers 602 tests  
✓ **Naming Conventions:** Test files follow `test_*.py` pattern  
✓ **Package Structure:** `__init__.py` files present in test directories  
✗ **Import Resolution:** Some imports need updating for new structure  

## Files Requiring Updates

### High Priority (Blocks Multiple Tests)

1. `src/fraud_detection/core/unified_fraud_detection_system.py`
   - Line 18: Update `from infrastructure.agent_orchestrator import ...`

### Medium Priority (Blocks Individual Tests)

2. `tests/integration/test_agent.py`
   - Line 4: Update `from agent_example import agent_invocation`

3. `tests/unit/memory/test_context_manager.py`
   - Line 10: Update `from .context_manager import ContextManager`

4. `tests/integration/test_memory_integration.py`
   - Line 292: Fix indentation error

5. `tests/integration/memory/test_create_memory.py`
   - Remove module-level `app.run()` call

## Conclusion

The reorganization has successfully:
- ✓ Consolidated tests into unified `tests/` directory
- ✓ Maintained test discoverability (602 tests found)
- ✓ Preserved test file structure and organization

However, **10 import errors were discovered that must be fixed**. These errors are a direct result of the reorganization and represent broken functionality that needs to be repaired.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: These Errors Must Be Fixed

The import errors are **not optional** - they represent broken tests and imports that resulted from the reorganization. The reorganization cannot be considered complete until these errors are resolved.

### Required Fixes (Priority Order)

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix `src/fraud_detection/core/unified_fraud_detection_system.py` (blocks 3 tests)
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Fix 4 test files with import/syntax issues
3. **LOW PRIORITY:** Install optional dependencies or skip those tests

**Next Steps:** These import issues **must be fixed immediately** as part of completing the reorganization, then re-run the full test suite to verify all tests pass.
