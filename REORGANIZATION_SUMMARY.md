## Key Decisions and Rationale

### 1. Adopted `src/` Layout

**Decision:** Use `src/fraud_detection/` instead of top-level `fraud_detection/`

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental imports from source directory
- Forces proper package installation
- Industry best practice for Python projects
- Better separation of source and other files

### 2. Merged Duplicate Web Interfaces

**Decision:** Consolidated `web_interface/` and `stress_testing/dashboards/`

**Rationale:**
- Eliminated code duplication
- Single source of truth for web components
- Easier maintenance
- Clearer ownership

### 3. Separated Unit and Integration Tests

**Decision:** Split tests into `unit/` and `integration/` directories

**Rationale:**
- Faster unit test execution
- Clearer test purposes
- Better CI/CD optimization
- Industry standard practice

### 4. Created `.archive/` Directory

**Decision:** Move historical artifacts to `.archive/` instead of deleting

**Rationale:**
- Preserve project history
- Maintain context for decisions
- Clean root directory
- Easy access when needed

### 5. Used `git mv` for File Moves

**Decision:** Use `git mv` to preserve file history

**Rationale:**
- Maintain git blame functionality
- Preserve commit history
- Enable `git log --follow`
- Better code archaeology
