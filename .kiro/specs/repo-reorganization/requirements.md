# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for reorganizing the fraud detection system repository to create a professional, maintainable structure suitable for presentation to stakeholders, potential employers, and the developer community. The repository has grown organically through iterative development, resulting in scattered files, duplicate functionality, and unclear module boundaries. This reorganization will establish a clean, logical structure while ensuring zero breakage of existing functionality.

The reorganization will consolidate related files, establish clear separation of concerns, move documentation to appropriate locations, archive development artifacts, and update all references to maintain full system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Zero-Breakage Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality to continue working after reorganization, so that the system remains operational without regression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Python module is moved THEN all import statements across the codebase SHALL be updated to reflect the new path
2. WHEN configuration files reference moved files THEN those references SHALL be updated to the new paths
3. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without modification to test logic
4. WHEN CI/CD workflows reference files THEN those references SHALL be updated to new paths
5. IF a file has dependencies on other files THEN those dependencies SHALL be identified and updated during the move
6. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN a validation script SHALL verify all imports resolve correctly

### Requirement 2: Logical Directory Structure
