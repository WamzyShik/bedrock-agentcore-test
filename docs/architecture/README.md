# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the Fraud Detection System.

## Contents

### [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
Complete system architecture documentation including:
- System overview and architecture diagrams
- Component descriptions and interactions
- Multi-agent coordination architecture
- Data flow and processing pipeline
- AWS Bedrock integration
- Memory and reasoning systems
- Deployment architecture
- Security architecture
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Quick Links

### Core Components
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Multi-agent coordination and decision aggregation
- **Transaction Processing Pipeline**: Validation, enrichment, routing, and response
- **Specialized Agents**: Transaction analyzer, pattern detector, risk assessor, compliance agent
- **Reasoning Engine**: Adaptive reasoning and explainable AI
- **Memory System**: Context management and pattern learning

### Integration Points
- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude 3 Sonnet integration for AI capabilities
- **API Gateway**: REST, WebSocket, and GraphQL endpoints
- **External Services**: Fraud databases, geolocation, identity verification
- **Streaming**: Real-time event processing

### Infrastructure
- **AWS Services**: Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
- **Deployment**: Blue-green deployment, auto-scaling, monitoring
- **Security**: IAM roles, encryption, audit logging

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for high-throughput processing
3. **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and graceful degradation
4. **Explainability**: Transparent decision-making with audit trails
5. **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
6. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for real-time fraud detection
