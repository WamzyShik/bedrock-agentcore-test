## 🚀 Demo Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Distribution
```
Agents: 3 (transaction analyzer, pattern detector, risk assessor)
Tasks: 5 mixed-type tasks
Strategy: Hybrid
Result: Tasks distributed based on specialization and load
```

### Scenario 2: Load Balancing
```
Initial Loads: 20%, 70%, 50%
Tasks: 10 identical tasks
Strategy: Least-loaded
Final Loads: 80%, 80%, 80% (balanced)
```

### Scenario 3: Specialization Routing
```
Agents: Transaction specialist (0.98), Pattern specialist (0.97), Generalist (0.60)
Tasks: Mixed transaction and pattern tasks
Result: Tasks routed to specialized agents
```

### Scenario 4: Priority Handling
```
Agent Capacity: 2 concurrent tasks
Tasks: 5 tasks (LOW to CRITICAL priority)
Result: CRITICAL → HIGH → NORMAL → LOW order
```

### Scenario 5: Hybrid Routing
```
Agents: Fast (low load), Expert (high specialization), Busy (high load)
Tasks: 15 tasks
Weights: Load 40%, Specialization 40%, Performance 20%
Result: Balanced distribution across all factors
```

### Scenario 6: Auto-Scaling
```
System Load: 80%
Scale-up Threshold: 70%
Result: Recommendation to add more agents
```
