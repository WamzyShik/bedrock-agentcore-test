# Task 8 Completion Summary: Organize Scripts and Utilities

## Overview
Successfully organized all scripts and utilities into a clear, categorized structure within the `scripts/` directory. All files were moved using `git mv` to preserve history.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 8.1 Organize Security Scripts ✅
Moved all security-related scripts to `scripts/security/`:
- `security_check.py` (from root)
- `run_security_audit.py` (from root)
- `security_audit.py` (from scripts/)
- `quick_security_check.sh` (from root)

### 8.2 Organize Release Scripts ✅
Moved all release management scripts to `scripts/release/`:
- `bump-version.py`
- `prepare-release.py`
- `validate-release.py`

### 8.3 Organize Development Scripts ✅
Moved development-related scripts to `scripts/development/`:
- `run_all_tests.py` (from tests/)
- `setup-branch-protection.sh`

### 8.4 Organize Utility Scripts ✅
Moved utility scripts to `scripts/utilities/` and test files to appropriate test directories:

**Utilities moved:**
- `currency_converter.py`
- `data_loader.py`
- `transaction_generator.py`
- `check_models.py`

**Test files moved to `tests/integration/`:**
- `test_agent.py`
- `test_api.py`
- `test_bedrock_foundation.py`
- `test_fraud_detection.py`
- `test_memory_integration.py`
- `test_multicurrency.py`
- `test_render_deployment.py`
- `test_with_files.py`

### 8.5 Create scripts/README.md ✅
Created comprehensive documentation for all scripts including:
- Directory structure overview
- Purpose and usage for each script
- Dependencies documentation
- Usage examples
- Best practices
- Contributing guidelines

## Final Directory Structure

```

```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Organization**: Scripts are now categorized by purpose, making them easy to find
2. **Better Discoverability**: Developers can quickly locate the right tool for their needs
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: README provides usage examples and dependency information
4. **Clean Root Directory**: Removed 12+ files from root, significantly reducing clutter
5. **Preserved History**: All moves used `git mv` to maintain file history
6. **Professional Structure**: Follows industry best practices for project organization

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ Requirement 9.1: Scripts categorized by function in scripts/ directory
- ✅ Requirement 9.2: Security scripts grouped together
- ✅ Requirement 9.4: Utility scripts clearly named and documented
- ✅ Requirement 9.5: Scripts README documents each script's purpose
- ✅ Requirement 9.6: Script dependencies documented

## Files Moved Summary

**Total files organized:** 20
- Security scripts: 4
- Release scripts: 3
- Development scripts: 2
- Utility scripts: 4
- Test files relocated: 8

## Next Steps

Task 8 is complete. The next task in the reorganization plan is:

**Task 9: Archive historical artifacts**
- Move task completion summaries to .archive/
- Move project reports to .archive/
- Create .archive/README.md
- Clean root directory of historical files

## Validation

All files successfully moved and organized:
```bash
# Verify security scripts
ls scripts/security/
# Output: security_check.py, security_audit.py, run_security_audit.py, quick_security_check.sh

# Verify release scripts
ls scripts/release/
# Output: bump-version.py, prepare-release.py, validate-release.py

# Verify development scripts
ls scripts/development/
# Output: run_all_tests.py, setup-branch-protection.sh

# Verify utility scripts
ls scripts/utilities/
# Output: currency_converter.py, data_loader.py, transaction_generator.py, check_models.py

# Verify README exists
cat scripts/README.md
```

## Notes

- All file moves preserved git history using `git mv`
- Test files were appropriately moved to `tests/integration/` as they are integration/manual test scripts
- The `scripts/reorganization/` directory was left intact as it contains active reorganization tooling
- No import updates were needed as these are standalone scripts
