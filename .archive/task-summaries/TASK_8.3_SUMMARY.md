     - Overall Compliance Score
     - Audit Trail Completeness
     - Data Breach Response Time
     - Policy Violation Rate

6. **Alert Management**
   - `get_active_alerts()` - Retrieve active alerts with filtering
   - `resolve_alert()` - Mark alerts as resolved with notes
   - Alert tracking with timestamps
   - Severity-based filtering

7. **Compliance Dashboard**
   - `get_compliance_dashboard()` - Real-time dashboard data
   - Overall compliance status
   - Metric summaries
   - Active alert counts
   - Requirements status breakdown

### 2. Demo Script (`demo_compliance_reporting.py`)

Comprehensive demonstration covering:

1. **Requirement Validation Demo**
   - Shows validation of PCI DSS encryption requirements
   - Demonstrates handling of incomplete evidence
   - Displays compliance scoring

2. **Report Generation Demo**
   - Generates reports for multiple jurisdictions
   - Shows executive summaries
   - Displays requirements summaries
   - Demonstrates report persistence

3. **Real-Time Monitoring Demo**
   - Normal operations scenario
   - Degraded compliance scenario
   - Alert generation and management
   - Alert resolution workflow

4. **Compliance Dashboard Demo**
   - Real-time metrics display
   - Requirements status overview
   - Active alerts summary

5. **Jurisdiction Templates Demo**
   - Shows all available templates
   - Displays template configurations
   - Lists required sections and signatures

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Extensible requirement database
- Pluggable validation logic
- Template-based report generation
- Event-driven monitoring system

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
1. **Audit Trail System** (`reasoning_engine/audit_trail.py`)
   - Integrates audit data into compliance reports
   - Uses audit events for compliance validation

2. **Compliance Agent** (`specialized_agents/compliance_agent.py`)
   - Can leverage the reporting system for automated reports
   - Shares regulatory requirement definitions

3. **Memory System** (`memory_system/`)
   - Can store compliance history
   - Track requirement validation over time

## Usage Example

```python
from reasoning_engine.compliance_reporting import (
    ComplianceReportingSystem,
    Jurisdiction,
    ReportFormat
)
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize system
system = ComplianceReportingSystem()

# Validate a requirement
evidence = {
    "encryption_enabled": True,
    "logging_enabled": True,
    "log_count": 5000
}
result = system.validate_requirement("PCI_DSS_3.2.1", evidence)

# Generate compliance report
report = system.generate_report(
    jurisdiction=Jurisdiction.US_FEDERAL,
    start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30),
    end_date=datetime.now(),
    audit_data=audit_data,
    format=ReportFormat.JSON
)

# Monitor compliance
alerts = system.monitor_compliance(audit_data)

# Get dashboard
dashboard = system.get_compliance_dashboard()
```

## Future Enhancements
