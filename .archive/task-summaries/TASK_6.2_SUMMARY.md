## üîß Key Components

### 1. Decision Aggregation Methods

```python
class AggregationMethod(Enum):
    MAJORITY_VOTE = "majority_vote"           # Simple majority wins
    WEIGHTED_VOTE = "weighted_vote"           # Weight by agent priority
    CONSENSUS = "consensus"                   # Require agreement
    EXPERT_OVERRIDE = "expert_override"       # Expert can override
    CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTED = "confidence_weighted" # Weight by confidence
    HYBRID = "hybrid"                         # Combination approach
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution Strategies

```python
class ConflictResolutionStrategy(Enum):
    MOST_CONSERVATIVE = "most_conservative"   # Choose safest option
    HIGHEST_CONFIDENCE = "highest_confidence" # Trust most confident
    EXPERT_PRIORITY = "expert_priority"       # Defer to expert
    WEIGHTED_AVERAGE = "weighted_average"     # Weighted combination
    ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN = "escalate_to_human"  # Human review needed
```
